# Music Recognition Firefox extension

The extension is based on the [Music Recognition API](https://audd.io).

## This is an experimental Firefox version. It won't work by default.

The extension uses Manifest V3; to enable the developer preview for it, as per [some website probably related to Mozilla](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/manifest-v3-migration-guide/), you need to go to `about:config`, and:
 - Set `extensions.manifestV3.enabled` to `true`.
 - Set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`.
 
After that, you can go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and add a temporary extension by selecting the `manifest.json`. Or install permamently on Firefox Developer Edition (on `about:addons`, install from a ZIP file containing the extension files, with `manifest.json` in the root).

## Current issues

Help is welcome!

- [Audio stops working on video changes if the extension was open](https://github.com/AudDMusic/firefox-extension/issues/4).

- Firefox doesn't seem to have the browser identity things that Chrome has, so auth is disabled and the AudD API will process only the first 10 requests. Once the extension is ready for release, we'll fix this.
