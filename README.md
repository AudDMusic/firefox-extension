# Music Recognition Firefox extension

The extension is based on the [Music Recognition API](https://audd.io).

Recognize any music from any website in your browser
Install the AudD extension and click on its icon to identify the song playing on the current tab.

You can [install this extension from the Firefox store](https://audd.cc/firefox).

## Current issues

Help will be appreciated.

- [Audio stops working on video changes if the extension was open](https://github.com/AudDMusic/firefox-extension/issues/4).

- Firefox doesn't seem to have the browser identity things that Chrome has, so auth is disabled and the AudD API will process only the first 10 requests. Once the extension is ready for release, we'll fix this.

## What it does

AudD extension:
- Recognizes the music playing in your browser;
- Finds music in the AudD database with more than 65 million songs using its music recognition technology;
- Shows lyrics for identified songs;
- Shows links to listen to the songs on Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, YouTube Music;
- Displays the exact moment in the recognized song when the sound from the browser is played.
