# Music Recognition Firefox extension

The extension is based on the [Music Recognition API](https://audd.io).

## This is an experimental Firefox version. It won't work by default.

The extension uses Manifest V3; to enable the developer preview for it, as per [some random website probably from Mozilla](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/manifest-v3-migration-guide/), you need to go to `about:config`, and:
 - Set `extensions.manifestV3.enabled` to `true`.
 - Set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`.
 
After that, you can go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and add a temporary extension by selecting the `manifest.json`.

## Current issues

I wasn't able to make Firefox add the extension permamently, from an archive. I don't know why, help would be welcome in #1.

The audio stops playing ater the extension stops recording it until the tab is reloaded, help would be welcome in #2.
